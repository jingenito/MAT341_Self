Notes on Terminal Commands
For me this is getting used to using the vi interface
This seems like a useful tool to edit files without leaving the command line

VI Commands:
vi [name].txt		opens vi editor in the current directory and creates the file if it doesnt exist
i	start editing
esc	stop editing
:[line_number]		jump to the specified line number
:w	save file
